                I am a dedicated Full-Stack Developer with a strong foundation in web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and Django. My journey in tech began with a curiosity for building user-friendly interfaces, which has evolved into a passion for creating seamless, efficient, and innovative digital solutions.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-foreground/90 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                With hands-on experience in front-end and back-end development, including Next.js, MySQL, MongoDB, and RESTful API creation, I thrive on transforming complex challenges into functional applications. My work at Genentech Solutions and Hakam Techsoul has honed my skills in building optimized, user-focused web experiences.

                When I'm not coding, you can find me playing cricket, gaming, or exploring new skills to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape. Iâ€™m also pursuing a Diploma in Web Development and an AI course with PIAIC to fuel my growth as a developer.
